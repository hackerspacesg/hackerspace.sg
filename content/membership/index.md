## Resident &mdash; $512 SGD monthly

A reserved desk for co-working. You can keep your stuff at the desk.  We'll
label a desk with your name, in honour of your contribution.

## Hotdesk &mdash; $256 SGD monthly

Priority at desks whenever you drop by the space (oversubscription may occur at
peak hours, we aim for 90% availability). You cannot keep your crap at the
desk.

## Regular Member &mdash; $128 SGD monthly

Use any of the open desks. Hang out on the sofas. Keep your crap in a locker (rental applies).
Use the workbench. Borrow books from our library. Keep your toys and tools onsite.

## Irregular Member &mdash; $64 SGD monthly

If you are a student or a starving hacker, all the benefits of regular
membership at a reduced rate. Also, if you really want to support the space but
don't come by regularly.

# I’m in, how do I sign up?

Drop by the Hackerspace and get to know us.

If you can commit to 6 months at one of the above membership levels, and can
pay for the first three months right now, pick up a membership from
HackerspaceSG. Hang out at HackerspaceSG for a week or two, just so that we can know
you better, and so that you are sure that you really want to be part of the
community.

Complete the <a href="/membership/MembershipAgreement.pdf"
target="_blank">form</a> and pass it to any member. You need two members to
support your application. Then, transfer funds, by doing a direct bank
transfer to the Hackerspace.SG Standard Chartered bank account:

	Bank code: 7144
	Branch code: 057
	Standard Chartered Account: 5701304090

The account name is `Hackerspace.SG Pte. Ltd`. and the bank code is
`scblsgsgxxx` (which is the swift code). Once you have the right bank code the
branch code of `057` should display on your internet banking interface.

Another painless way is to use PayPal to enter a regular monthly
subscription.  Please note that fees levied by PayPal will be absorbed by you.
