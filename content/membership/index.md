## Membership Tiers

### Resident &mdash; $512 SGD monthly

A reserved desk for co-working. You can keep your stuff at the desk.  We'll
label a desk with your name, in honour of your contribution.

### Hotdesk &mdash; $256 SGD monthly

Priority at desks whenever you drop by the space (oversubscription may occur at
peak hours, we aim for 90% availability). You cannot keep your crap at the
desk.

### Regular Member &mdash; $128 SGD monthly

Use any of the open desks. Hang out on the sofas. Keep your crap in a locker (rental applies).
Use the workbench. Borrow books from our library. Keep your toys and tools onsite.

### Broke Member &mdash; $64 SGD monthly

If you are a student or a starving hacker, all the benefits of regular
membership at a reduced rate. Also, if you really want to support the space, but
don't come by regularly.

## How do I sign up?

Drop by HackerspaceSG and get to know us. Hang out for a week or two, just so that we can know
you better, and so that you are sure that you really want to be part of the community.

Complete the <a href="/membership/MembershipAgreement.pdf"
target="_blank">membership form</a> and pass it to any member. You need two members to
support your application.

We accept membership payments via direct bank
transfer to the Hackerspace.SG Standard Chartered bank account:

	Bank code: 7144
	Branch code: 057
	Account Number: 5701304090

The account name is `Hackerspace.SG Pte. Ltd`. and the bank code is
`scblsgsgxxx` (which is the SWIFT code). Once you have the right bank code the
branch code of `057` should display on your internet banking interface.

Another painless way is to use PayPal to enter into a monthly
subscription.
