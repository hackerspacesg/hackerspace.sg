## Resident 512SGD monthly

A reserved desk for co-working. You can keep your stuff at the desk.  We'll
label a desk with your name, in honour of your contribution.

## Hotdesk 256SGD monthly

Priority at desks whenever you drop by the space (oversubscription may occur at
peak hours, we aim for 90% availability). You cannot keep your crap at the
desk.

## Regular Member 128SGD monthly

Hang out on the sofas. Keep your crap in a locker (rental rates applicable).
Use the workbench. Keep your toys and tools onsite.

## Irregular Member 64SGD monthly

If you are a student or you’re a starving hacker, all the benefits of regular
membership at a reduced rate. Also if you really want to support the space but
don't come by regularly at all.

# I’m in, how do I sign up?

Drop by the Hackerspace and get to know us.

If you can commit to 6 months of one of the above membership levels, and can
pay for the first three months right now, pick up a membership from
HackerspaceSG. Hang out at HackerspaceSG for a week, just so that we can know
you better, and so that you are sure that your really want to be part of the
community.

Complete the <a href="/membership/MembershipAgreement.pdf"
target="_blank">form</a> and pass it to any member. You need two members to
support your application. Then, transfer funds, by doing a direct bank
transfer to the Hackerspace.SG Standard Chartered bank account:

	Bank code: 7144
	Branch code: 057
	Standard Chartered Account: 5701304090

The account name should be Hackerspace.SG Pte. Ltd. and the bank code is
scblsgsgxxx (which is the swift code). Once you have the right bank code the
branch code of `057` should display on your internet banking interface.

Another painless way is to use Paypal to enter a regular monthly
subscription.  Please note that fees levied by Paypal will be absorbed by you.
