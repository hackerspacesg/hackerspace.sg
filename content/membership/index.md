## How do I sign up?

Drop by HackerspaceSG and get to know us. Hang out for a week or two, just so that we can know you better, and so that you are sure that you really want to be part of the community.

(Please refer to the [best times to visit](#best-times-to-visit) below.)

Complete the <a href="/membership/MembershipAgreement.pdf"
target="_blank">membership form</a> and pass it to any member. You need two members to support your application.

We accept membership payments via direct bank
transfer to the HackerspaceSG Standard Chartered bank account:

	Bank code: 7144
	Branch code: 057
	Account Number: 5701304090

The account name is `Hackerspace.SG Pte. Ltd`. and the bank code is
`scblsgsgxxx` (which is the SWIFT code). Once you have the right bank code the
branch code of `057` should display on your internet banking interface.

Another painless way is to use PayPal to enter into a monthly
subscription.
