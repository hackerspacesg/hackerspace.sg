## I'd like to visit Hackerspace. Do I need to make an appointment?

No. Just drop by. There are usually people around between noon and midnight.

If you want to make sure you get your money's worth, check the [calendar](/calendar) and pick an event.

## Do you guys, like, break into websites and steal passwords and Bitcoins and stuff?

No. [We're hackers, not crackers.](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/hacker-vs-cracker/)

## I'm looking for a co-working office for my non-tech business. Should I take a desk at HSG?

Tech startups are welcome at HSG. Non-tech startups might be more comfortable at a [commercial co-working space](http://e27.co/surviving-in-the-jungle-of-singapores-co-working-space/).
