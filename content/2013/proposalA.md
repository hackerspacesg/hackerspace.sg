# 20% rise in fees

* Resident 512SGD monthly &rarr; 615SGD
* Hotdesk 256SGD monthly &rarr; 300SGD
* Regular Member 128SGD monthly &rarr; 150 SGD
* Irregular Member 64SGD monthly &rarr; 75SGD

Rationale: Lived in Singapore lately? Prices have gone UP and a 20% hike since
2008 isn't bad going.

# Removal of categories that are not used

* <strike>Resident 615SGD</strike>
* <strike>Hotdesk 300SGD</strike>
* Regular Member 150 SGD

Rationale: IIUC no member is on Resident of Hotdesk tier

For higher bracket revenue, I'd like to propose corporate sponsorship: http://hsgcorpsponsor.dabase.com/

# Renaming of categories

* Regular Member 150 SGD &rarr; Co-working member 150 SGD monthly
* Irregular Member 75 SGD &rarr; Member 75 SGD monthly

Rationale: "Irregular Member" sounds bad when really this should be the bulk of our audience.
