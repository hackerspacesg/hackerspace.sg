# Bank of development boards

## Intro

### Goals

1. Inform about boards and shields available for sharing.
2. Connect with people that played/used particular tech.

### Lending procedure

- All boards should ideally stay at HackerSpace at all time.
- Just mail the person that is owner of the board to lend or express interest.

## List of available boards
