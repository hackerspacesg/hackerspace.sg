## About Hackerspace.SG

There are dozens of <a href="http://www.hackerspaces.org/">hackerspaces</a> around the world.

Hackerspace.sg is Singapore's Hackerspace.

Built by and for geeks, nerds, inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs,
hackerspace.sg will be the hacker community's living room and laboratory.  You
can hang out in the evenings.  You can work during the day.  And weâ€™ll host
meetups and movie nights for the local scene.

The local hacker community have selflessly volunteered their time, energy, and
money to make this happen.
