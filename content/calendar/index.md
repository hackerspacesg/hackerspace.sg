# Rojak calendar

Why rojak, you may ask? Rojak, which means “wild mix” or “combination of
ingredients” in Malay, is built on a vibrant assortment of fresh fruits and
vegetables, which may include pineapple, cucumber, sweet turnip, water spinach,
green apple, beansprouts, water apple, green mango, guava, slivers of lime
zest, and shredded ginger bud.

This calendar aggregates the calendar for SGEntrepreneurs, HackerspaceSG,
Geek/Tech/Dev/Design, TheList.sg, and Barcamp. We apologise for the duplication of events as
there doesn’t seem to be any other easier way to show you the interesting
events (excluding HackerspaceSG’s cleaning every Tuesday, of course).
