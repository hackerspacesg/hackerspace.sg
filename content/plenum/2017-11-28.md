- Summary position? (discussed)
- Organisational structure (particuarly reincorporating as an association). This discussion is paused while we stablise with a view to reviewing before end of April. We expect to switch to e.g. association if (but not only if) either:

  - The "What are we about?" discussion leads to consensus about doing this.
- Recognised a need to work out what we are about ahead of recruiting drive.
