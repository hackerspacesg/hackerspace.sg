### HackerspaceSG Future
- Outlined [proposed role for Fazli](https://github.com/hackerspacesg/admin/wiki/Fazli-admin-proposal) (approximately treasurer)
- Discussed paid-for vs. community-volunteer execution of formal tasks.
- Agreed that having an appointed volunteer accountable to the directors/committee is appropriate, rather than just listing things that need doing and hoping that people do so on an ad hoc basis.
- Lack of consensus on whether dependence upon a volunteer is appropriate for specialist technical work with compliance consequences.
