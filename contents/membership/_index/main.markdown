#### Open Storage

Members receive 22L of free storage for every $64 SGD of monthly membership subscription, and can rent additional storage at $5 SGD per 22L. For example, Community members paying $128 a month get 44L of free storage.

Please subscribe to additional storage whether you're using HackerspaceSG's supplied boxes, your own storage containers (e.g. suitcases), or storing large individual items (e.g. bicycles) at the premises. HackerspaceSG admin will be in touch if we believe that you should enter into a subscription.

For HackerspaceSG boxes, storage rental is billed whether the boxes are in HackerspaceSG or elsewhere. Boxes should be returned in reusable condition when you end your subscription term. If a box is damaged or missing, a replacement fee will be billed at $12 per 22L box, and $25 per 44L box. The replacement fee will be waived if you've paid 12 months of storage subscription for that box.

Open storage is offered subject to space availability, and allocations may be terminated (with notice) if we do not have enough space. We're not looking to enter the self-service storage business. HackerspaceSG admin may move boxes and other stored items at our discretion, especially if they get in the way of normal activities.
