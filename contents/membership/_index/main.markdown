## How do I sign up?

Drop by HackerspaceSG and get to know us. Hang out for a week or two, just so that we can know
you better, and so that you are sure that you really want to be part of the community.

Complete the <a href="/membership/MembershipAgreement.pdf"
target="_blank">membership form</a> and pass it to any member. You need two members to
support your application.

We accept membership payments via direct bank
transfer to the Hackerspace.SG Standard Chartered bank account:

	Bank code: 7144
	Branch code: 057
	Account Number: 5701304090

The account name is `Hackerspace.SG Pte. Ltd`. and the bank code is
`scblsgsgxxx` (which is the SWIFT code). Once you have the right bank code the
branch code of `057` should display on your internet banking interface.

Another painless way is to use PayPal to enter into a monthly
subscription.
