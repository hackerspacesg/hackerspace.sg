### Broke something? Need it printed?
Go to our friendly neighbourhood Hackerspace and Bob will print it for you (for a nice exchange).

### No design?

No problem at all! Our printer comes with a 3D engineer, it works most of the time and if it does not, just poke it with the engine stick. Or you could buy him a meal.
