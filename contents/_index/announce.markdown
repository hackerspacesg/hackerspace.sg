# Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) measures

Singapore is currently in the [updated Phase 3 (Heightened Alert)](https://www.gov.sg/article/updates-to-phase-3-heightened-alert-measures), in effect most likely until Sunday, 8 August 2021.

1. We will be following the [government-issued safe management measures for workspaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures).

2. HackerspaceSG is open for members to work on their own projects. Non-members may also make an appointment to visit if they wish to [join as members](/membership).

3. Members are allowed to host one guest at a time, if collaboration on their projects is necessary. Note that pre-booking is required (see below), and that social gatherings are not allowed.

4. All members are encouraged to follow and enforce safe management measures while in the space.

5. Please wear your masks at all times, except during activities that require masks to be removed.

6. Everyone must check into `Hackerspace.SG Pte Ltd` using TraceTogether / SafeEntry.

If members would like to host a guest in the space, they must email contact@hackerspace.sg, at least 1 calendar day before the intended visit, with the following information:

  1. Your guest's name
  2. Your guest's contact number
  3. "I acknowledge that I am aware of my obligations to ensure that my guest and I comply with the Ministry of Manpower's COVID-19 requirements for Safe Management Measures at the workplace."

Stay safe, and keep hacking!
