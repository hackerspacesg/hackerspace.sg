# Welcome to HackerspaceSG

**Hackerspace.SG** is Singapore's very own Hackerspace, and the Singapore tech scene's community centre. 

There are hundreds of such [hackerspaces](http://www.hackerspaces.org/) around the world, where people with common interests in computers, technology, science, digital and electronic art, come together to meet, socialise and collaborate.

Built by and for geeks, nerds, inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs, Hackerspace.SG is the Singapore hacker community's home, living room and laboratory.  Come hang out with the community in the evenings.  Co-work with us during the day.  We also host regular events, meetups, presentations, workshops, and movie nights for the local community.

HSG also happens to be Singapore's first co-working space.
