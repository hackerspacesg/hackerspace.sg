## Ongoing business

### Change of Directorship and Adding of Shareholders
- (Bob, Robert, Dyana, Jen, Valentine, Ruiwen, Roland) Discussion.
- (Valentine/Jen) to complete file transfer due to Google Drive not allowing ownership transfer from dyana's Drive to either Valentine/Jen's emails
- Decision to issue a third share, issue it to Valentine, no change to existing shares.
- (Valentine) Start process to issue and assign third share and transfer directorship.
- (Valentine/Roland) Draft doc to set out publicly the details of the change above, the rationale, and likely impacts.
  - Clarify that it is envisaged that so long as we remain a Pte. Ltd., Valentine's share should probably move to any future director, not that it's compensation for service.

### Broken and Orphaned Items
- (Valentine) Updates if any.
- Current list of candidate items: https://github.com/hackerspacesg/old-hardware-pattern/issues

### Rewording of Membership Tiers
- Pull request: https://github.com/hackerspacesg/hackerspace.sg/pull/171

- (Jen and/or Valentine) Send notice to community and concessionary members.
- (Valentine) Draft the sorts of tasks that community and concessionary members are to be asked to undertake
- (Valentine) Refine text to set out intended uses of each tier. Also, more friendly.
- (Valentine) Separate 16 and 32 to make clear that they are regular donation tiers, not membership tiers.
- (Valentine) 64 tier to be either fulltime study or self-declared under-2,500/month
