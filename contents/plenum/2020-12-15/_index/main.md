### Membership Marketing and Website Revamp

- (Valentine) Add PayNow QR to membership page for donations.

## Agenda:

### Rewording of Membership Tiers
- (Valentine) Idea is that we should not be seen as _just_ a cheap co-working space.
- We have 12 desks in the main area, and 5 desks in the front area (caa 2020-10-30).
- 17 x $256 is $4,352 (still not enough to cover running the space).
- Propose to [anchor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)) $256/month as the standard membership tier.
- Propose to reword the $512 tier to Dedicated tier, $256 tier to Co-working tier, and $128 tier to Community tier.
- Pull request: https://github.com/hackerspacesg/hackerspace.sg/pull/171
