## Followup from last meeting

### Broken and Orphaned Items
- (Valentine) Updates if any.
- Seeking consensus to [Old Hardware Pattern](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/The_Old_Hardware_Pattern) the following:
  - Sofa under the projector
  - Large waterspot-marked table top opposite the shelves
  - Worn out office chairs
  - High chairs
  - Beanbags


### Membership Survey
- (Valentine) Updates if any.

### Membership Marketing and Website Revamp
- (Robert) Update on revamp.
- (Valentine) Propose to remove this since the agenda item has been stagnant for [2.5 years](https://hackerspace.sg/plenum/2018-05-17/).
- (Valentine) Add PayNow QR to membership page for donations.

## Agenda

### Rewording of Membership Tiers
- (Valentine) Idea is that we should not be seen as _just_ a cheap co-working space.
- We have 12 desks in the main area, and 5 desks in the front area (caa 2020-10-30).
- 17 x $256 is $4,352 (still not enough to cover running the space).
- Propose to [anchor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_(cognitive_bias)) $256/month as the standard membership tier.
- Propose to reword the $512 tier to Dedicated tier, $256 tier to Co-working tier, and $128 tier to Community tier.
- Pull request: https://github.com/hackerspacesg/hackerspace.sg/pull/171
